# GNL

This program is the 42 school **get next line** project.

Its goal is to **read from a text file** and **return the next line it reads**, stopping when it meets a newline or reaches the end of file.
When called in a loop, the program must be able to return an entire text file. It can also read from the standard input.

This program allowed me to validate the GNL project with a score of 100/100.
